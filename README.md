# Solar Radiation Forecast 

This repository has been created for the acquisition and post-processing of atmospheric variables coming from the **Global Forecast System (GFS)** meteorological prediction model, in order to develop an intraday solar radiation forecast for the Colombian region and their in-situ verification.

This documentation describes the general use of the library and details the handling of files and analysis results corresponding to meteorological data for a period of one (5) years, obtained for the city of **Medell√≠n- Colombia**, as benchmarking.

Likewise, the methodology using neural networks is outlined and included in the library, where the use of these atmospheric variables is used for building and training a neural network model for the forecast of intraday solar irradiance. The meteorological model will be developed and operated using the Microsoft Azure resources and its results will be validated with local irradiance measurements.

This project attempts to help the optimization of photovoltaic solar energy production at different strategic points in Colombia and eventually it is desired that the library includes the conversion of the solar resource to solar energy potential for site resource assessment and techniques for the optimization of solar energy integration into the electricity grid.
